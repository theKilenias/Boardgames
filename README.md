# Boardgames
Collection of some randomizers I wrote for my favorite boardgames.

Currently I have unfinished randomizers for the german versions of Spirit Island and Aeon's End FÃ¼r die Ewigkeit online.
Since the Aeon's End base games are compatible with each other I will add the first wave of cards over the year.  Addtionally I want to add the possibility to choose the wave the randomizer should use.

As for Spirit Island I want to overhaul the whole thing at some point in the future.
